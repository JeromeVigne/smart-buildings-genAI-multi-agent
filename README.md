# Multi-agent AI sample with Azure Cosmos DB

A sample personal shopping AI Chatbot that can help with product enquiries, making sales, and refunding orders by transferring to different agents for those tasks.

Features:
- **Multi-agent**: [OpenAI Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) to orchestrate multi-agent interactions with [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) API calls.
- **Transactional data management**: planet scale [Azure Cosmos DB database service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) to store transactional user and product operational data.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: [vector search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search) in Azure Cosmos DB with powerful [DiskANN index](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/diskann-fast-accurate-billion-point-nearest-neighbor-search-on-a-single-node/?msockid=091c323873cd6bd6392120ac72e46a98) to serve product enquiries from the same database.
- **Gradio UI**: [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) to provide a simple UI ChatBot for the end-user.

## Overview

The personal shopper example includes four main agents to handle various customer service requests:

1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
2. **Product Agent**: Answers customer queries from the products container using [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/rag).
2. **Refund Agent**: Manages customer refunds, requiring both user ID and item ID to initiate a refund.
3. **Sales Agent**: Handles actions related to placing orders, requiring both user ID and product ID to complete a purchase.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Cosmos DB account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal) - ensure the [vector search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search) feature is enabled.
- [Azure OpenAI API key](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) and endpoint.
- [Azure OpenAI Embedding Deployment ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) for the RAG model.

## Setup

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/multi-agent-swarm
cd multi-agent-swarm
